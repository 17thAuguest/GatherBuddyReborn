GatherBuddyReborn is a community-made fork of the original GatherBuddy plugin for Final Fantasy XIV. This tool is designed to enhance your gameplay experience by assisting with all things gathering, now with automated routes via vnavmesh.

## Features

- **AutoGather**: Automated pathing for gathering up to 10 full stacks (999 each) of a resource.
- **Resource Queueing**: Create a list of resources you want and GBR will gather up to 10 stacks of each!
  
## Installing
- Enter `/xlsettings` in the chat window and go to the Experimental tab in the opening window.
- **Skip below the DevPlugins section to the Custom Plugin Repositories section.**
- Copy and paste the repo.json link into the first free text input field.
```

```
- Click on the + button and make sure the checkmark beside the new field is set afterwards.
- **Click on the Save-icon in the bottom right.**

Following these steps, you should be able to see all contained plugins in the Available Plugins tab in the Dalamud Plugin Installer.
No Plugins will be installed, you have just made them available. You can now select which of these plugins you actually want to install.
